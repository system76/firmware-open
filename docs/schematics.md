# Schematics

## Systems using System76 Open Firmware

System76 customers may request board schematics for their system by sending an
email to `firmware@system76.com` with the subject line:

> Schematics for &lt;model&gt;

where `<model>` is a model that uses firmware-open. Include the serial number
of your system for verification.

You may not share these without explicit permission from System76.

## Other models and components

System76 cannot provide schematics for models not using firmware-open, nor
datasheets for any components that are not already publicly available.
