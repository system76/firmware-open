/**
  GPIO interrupt configuration
  This setting is applicable only if pad is in GPIO mode and has input enabled.
  GPIO_INT_CONFIG allows to choose which interrupt is generated (IOxAPIC/SCI/SMI/NMI)
  and how it is triggered (edge or level). Refer to PADCFG_DW0 register description in
  EDS for details on this settings.
  Field from GpioIntNmi to GpioIntApic can be OR'ed with GpioIntLevel to GpioIntBothEdge
  to describe an interrupt e.g. GpioIntApic | GpioIntLevel
  If GPIO is set to cause an SCI then also GPI_GPE_EN is enabled for this pad.
  If GPIO is set to cause an NMI then also GPI_NMI_EN is enabled for this pad.
  Not all GPIO are capable of generating an SMI or NMI interrupt.
  When routing GPIO to cause an IOxAPIC interrupt care must be taken, as this
  interrupt cannot be shared and its IRQn number is not configurable.
  Refer to EDS for GPIO pads IRQ numbers (PADCFG_DW1.IntSel)
  If GPIO is under GPIO OS driver control and appropriate ACPI GpioInt descriptor
  exist then use only trigger type setting (from GpioIntLevel to GpioIntBothEdge).
  This type of GPIO Driver interrupt doesn't have any additional routing setting
  required to be set by BIOS. Interrupt is handled by GPIO OS Driver.
