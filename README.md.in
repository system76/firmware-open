# System76 Open Firmware

An open source distribution of firmware utilizing coreboot, EDK2, and System76
firmware applications.

## Supported models

These models are supported and will receive updates through the firmware
manager:

- bonw14
- darp6
- galp4
- lemp9
- oryp6

Other models may be in development or available without support, and can be
seen in the `models/` directory.

If the device becomes bricked it will require restoring the current firmware
using an external programmer. See [flashing](./docs/flashing.md) for details.

### Schematics

Board schematics can be provided on request by sending an email to
firmware@system76.com with the subject line  "Schematics for _model_", where
_model_ is the name of a directory in the `models/` directory, such as darp6.

You may not share these without explicit permission from System76.
